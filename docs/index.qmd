# Welcome

My name is Jose and I am continuing my medical career in Cleveland, Ohio. I am a researcher at the Cleveland clinic and a student at the Master of Public Health at Case Western Reserve University.My research include heart failure and public health. I am focused on large-scale assessment of cardiac surgical outcomes from a public health perspective.

On this website, you will find a selection of the work I am involved with. You will also find news and updates on my current projects, as well as information on upcoming events. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life's work as a scientist and entrepreneur. If I am not working, I enjoy playing tennis, listening to music and spending time with friends and family.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.dizferj@ccf.org) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
